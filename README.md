## Background information:

These example problems are similar to what we run into where we get car data
from a wide variety of sources, and need to normalize the data. Many times users
will have typos or use shorthand in a given field.

## Instructions:

Please complete the `normalize_data` function below to make the examples pass.
Feel free to add classes or helper methods as needed. Include the version of
ruby you ran your code in as a comment at the top of the file.

## Things to consider:

+   `trim` refers to different features or packages for the same model of vehicle;
+   Valid years are from 1900 until 2 years in the future from today;
+   A value that can't be normalized should be returned as is;
+   Sometimes the trim of a vehicle will be provided in the `model` field, and
will need to be extracted to the `trim` field;
+   The word `blank` should be returned as nil.

### Code:

```ruby
def normalize_data(input)

end

examples = [
  [{ :year => '2018', :make => 'fo', :model => 'focus', :trim => 'blank' },
   { :year => 2018, :make => 'Ford', :model => 'Focus', :trim => nil }],
  [{ :year => '200', :make => 'blah', :model => 'foo', :trim => 'bar' },
   { :year => '200', :make => 'blah', :model => 'foo', :trim => 'bar' }],
  [{ :year => '1999', :make => 'Chev', :model => 'IMPALA', :trim => 'st' },
   { :year => 1999, :make => 'Chevrolet', :model => 'Impala', :trim => 'ST' }],
  [{ :year => '2000', :make => 'ford', :model => 'focus se', :trim => '' },
   { :year => 2000, :make => 'Ford', :model => 'Focus', :trim => 'SE' }]
]

examples.each_with_index do |(input, expected_output), index|
  if (output = normalize_data(input)) == expected_output
    puts "Example #{index + 1} passed!"
  else
    puts "Example #{index + 1} failed,
          Expected: #{expected_output.inspect}
          Got:      #{output.inspect}"
  end
end
```
